This project was created with the intention of assembling a butler for the DialogWizard team, in the beginning it was only for him to manage our group. But an idea came up! create a butler capable of managing not only the group, but also our other bots, servers and functions that facilitate the work of our team.

The project is in its infancy, like everything done from scratch - let's start at the beginning, with little information, a mistake here, another there, after all we are trying to create something new and we do not know how far we go with this - It is worth remembering that we do not intend in letting all our code openly available, but let's leave the code skeleton and some scripts for development study. And to make it easier to understand our base, we've created a wiki so that anyone can understand how our project works.

However, we warn you that to understand everything, you need to have some programming knowledge, preferably in python (basic project language) and to understand a bit about the structure of the code.
